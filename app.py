    - There are 54 features in the dataset. 
    - The features having less than x number of unique values are considered semi-categorical&copy; features here. 
    - The rest of the features are continuous. 
    - Use the navigation sidebar to navigate through this app. 
    - There is a slider to adjust the heights of the figures. 
    - This was originally made using matplotlib and seaborn. 
    - BUT after discovering plotly, which makes graphs interactive, I decided to use it instead.
